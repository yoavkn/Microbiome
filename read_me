This program receives bacteria names and and mass spectrometry raw files.
It creates a proteome of proteins that were found in the samples.
It downloads fasta files of the organisms from Uniprot website.
The program uses fragpipe and it should be downloaded on the computer.

directory folder contains:
    resources folder:
        fragpipe_files->(fragger.params, fragpipe.workflow, fragpipe-files.fp-manifest)
        fasta->combined_proteome (if the user wants to expand an existing proteome fasta file)
    first_step folder:
        should contain raw files samples for analysing using ms fragger and Human_Top_100.fasta.

fragpipe_directory: directory in which fragpipe was downloaded
format: "fragpipe_directory"

directory: directory containing the folders "first_step" and "recourses"
format: "directory"

adding_to_existing_fasta: value that represents if there is already an existing fasta file that you wish to expand.
format: "true"/"false"

raw_file_list: list of names of raw files you want to run.
format: 'raw1','raw2','raw3'...

organisms_list: list of organisms that you wish to add/build the proteome according to their proteins.
format: 'Actinomyces+naeslundii','Actinomyces+oris','Corynebacterium+amycolatum'...

number_of_fastas_to_download: number of fastas that will be downloaded from each organism for checking fasta files
validity from uniprot
format: 20

the input should be in the format:
fragpipe_directory directory adding_to_existing_fasta raw_file_list organisms_list number_of_fastas_to_download

input example:
